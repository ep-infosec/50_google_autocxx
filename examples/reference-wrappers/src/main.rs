// This example serves to demonstrate the experimental C++
// reference wrappers. They exist because C++ references are not
// the same as Rust references: C++ references may alias, whereas
// Rust references may not.
//
// Standard autocxx behavior therefore introduces unsoundness when
// C++ references are encountered and treated like Rust references.
// (cxx has this soundness problem for Trivial types; autocxx
// makes it worse in that the same problem applies even for
// opaque types, because we make them sized such that we can allocate
// them on the stack).
//
// Reference wrappers solve that problem because internally, they're
// just pointers. On the other hand, they're awkward to use,
// especially in the absence of the Rust "arbitrary self types"
// feature.

// Necessary to be able to call methods on reference wrappers.
// For that reason, this example only builds on nightly Rust.

    // been given.
    // Therefore, at this point in the program, it's still
    // OK to take Rust references to this Field.
